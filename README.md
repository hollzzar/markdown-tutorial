# Cognitive Area Brownbag: R Markdown for Graduate Students

This repository contains presentation and practice materials for developing knowledge in R Markdown. I developed these materials for the Penn State Psychology Cognitive Area's weekly Brownbag meeting. 

The slides provide a review of the core aspects of an R Markdown document: YAML, markup, and code chunks. They also highlight features that will be particularly useful to graduate students. I include information not only on different output and template options, but also on how to customize them for creating CVs, posters, presentations, publications, and reports. I hope to expand these materials in the future to include creating websites with R Markdown.

The practice materials will help reinforce the information presented in the slides. The materials also give students an opportunity to practice `tidyr` skills, which aim to make R code more transparent (and more intuitive to create).
